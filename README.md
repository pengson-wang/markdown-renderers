# Markdown Renderers

This repositories contains various of markdown renderers which was designed for load as a plugin in [Markdown Previewer](https://github.com/pengson-wang/markdown-previewer). And, it's ok to use it in any framework since it's exposed as [web-components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). Have fun!

# Progress
By now only one render available for use (not from npm). You can follow the approuch in [examples/web-components.html](examples/web-components.html). Or use the `es` format if you like.
